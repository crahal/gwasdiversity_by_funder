# gwasdiversity_by_funder
A repository to build a prototype of a new tab for the GWAS Diversity Monitor.

This readme.md is designed to document things that I think need further discussion or review within the repo/the broader body of work.

1. Do we want the search functionality to be via Agency or via Acronym?
2. Do we still want to keep Associations for the doughnut, even if it only filters for the initial stage?
